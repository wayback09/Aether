# Aether SDK

The Aether SDK (`@aether/sdk`) is the official development companion for building Aether extensions. It is a purely development-time package — it never ships inside your extension at runtime.

## CLI vs SDK

These are two separate but connected tools:

- **CLI** (`aether`) — what you run in your terminal. Scaffolds projects, runs dev mode, packages extensions.
- **SDK** (`@aether/sdk`) — what you import inside your extension's code. Provides types and helper utilities.

## The Problem It Solves

The `Aether` global object is injected directly into every extension's sandbox by the Go runtime. Without the SDK, the developer experience is rough:

- No autocompletion — editors don't know what `Aether.ui` or `Aether.instances` contains.
- No type safety — a typo like `Aether.instances.patcH()` is only caught at runtime.
- No friendly error messages — raw sandbox errors are cryptic.

The SDK fixes all of this without changing the runtime.

## What the SDK Contains

### 1. TypeScript Definitions

The most important part. A `.d.ts` file that tells your editor exactly what every Aether API accepts and returns. No code from this runs at runtime — it is purely for your editor:

```typescript
declare global {
  const Aether: {
    ui: {
      registerSidebarPage(opts: { id: string; label: string; url: string }): void;
      openDialog(opts: any): void;
    };
    instances: {
      list(): { id: string; name: string; version: string; loader: string }[];
      installMod(instanceId: string, jarName: string, downloadURL: string): string;
    };
    http: {
      get(url: string): string;
    };
    fs: {
      download(url: string, destPath: string): string;
    };
    launcher: {
      registerModLoader(config: { id: string; name: string; description: string; onLaunch: (ctx: any) => any }): void;
    };
    skins: {
      export(base64Data: string, filename: string): string;
    };
  };
}
```

### 2. Helper Utilities

Thin wrappers that make common patterns cleaner and catch mistakes earlier:

```javascript
import { onReady, createLogger } from '@aether/sdk';

const log = createLogger('my-extension');

onReady(() => {
  log.info('Extension started');

  Aether.ui.registerSidebarPage({
    id: 'my-page',
    label: 'My Page',
    url: 'ui/index.html',
  });
});
```

Available helpers:

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `onReady(fn)` | Runs your function once the sandbox is fully initialised |
| `createLogger(name)` | Returns a namespaced logger (`log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error`) |
| `defineProvider(spec)` | Registers a typed Loader Provider with validation |
| `assertPermission(perm)` | Throws a clear error if a required permission was not declared |

## Versioning

The `"api"` field in `manifest.json` ties directly to the SDK version:

```json
{
  "api": "1.0"
}
```

When you install `@aether/sdk@1.0`, you get types and helpers that match Aether's runtime API at that version exactly. When Aether ships a new API version, `aether migrate` updates your manifest and you run:

```
npm install @aether/sdk@2.0
```

## What the SDK Does NOT Do

- It does not ship any JavaScript into your packaged extension.
- It does not replace the `Aether` global — that is always injected by the Go runtime.
- It does not add a runtime dependency to your `.aex` file.

The Go runtime is the single source of truth for what APIs actually exist. The SDK is a development-time mirror of that truth.

## Full Developer Flow

```
aether init
  └─ scaffolds project, installs @aether/sdk

Edit main.js
  └─ full autocomplete and type checking via SDK

aether dev
  └─ connects to a running Aether instance, hot-reloads on save

aether validate
  └─ checks your manifest against the declared SDK/API version

aether build
  └─ bundles into a .aex file, SDK types stripped automatically
```

## Installation (Planned)

```
npm install --save-dev @aether/sdk
```

The SDK will be published to npm when the extension ecosystem reaches a stable API. Until then, the TypeScript definitions are available directly inside the `extensions-src/` directory of the core repository as a reference.
